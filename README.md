# Implementation-of-Logistic-Regression-from-scratch-for-Iris-Dataset-Classification

## About
Implementation of the Logistic Regression model from scratch, where the model is then used for Iris Dataset Classification, and the model is then evaluated using the various evaluation metrics.
In our implementation we used the softmax function to transform the output scores to probabilities & be used in our training & evaluation process.

## Evaluation Metrics
All of the Evaluation metrics used in our evaluation were implemented from scratch, where we used the micro evaluation scores for the multiclass classification, where first we get the true positives, true negatives, false positives, false negatives, for each class with respect to the other classes, then we use these computed variables to get the total true positives, total true negatives, total false positives, total false negatives of our model to get the overall evaluation metrics.
